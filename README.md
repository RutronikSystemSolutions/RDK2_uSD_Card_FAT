### Using the code example with a ModusToolbox IDE:

1. Import the project: **File** > **Import...** > **General** > **Existing Projects into Workspace** > **Next**.
2. Select the directory where **"RDK2_uSD_Card_FAT"** resides and click  **Finish**.
3. Select and build the project **Project ** > **Build Project**.

### Operation

The program initiates the uSD hardware and FAT file system. Tries to mount the uSD card and if succeeds creates a test file, then opens and reads it indefinitely to make sure no errors ever occur.
